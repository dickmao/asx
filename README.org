This package allows you to search any StackExchange site specified in
`asx-sites` and insert the top post in an Org-mode buffer. For better searching,
this uses Google as it is superior to StackExchange's searching capabilities.

Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cs6cb4/instant_stackoverflow_solutions_in_emacs_without/][this reddit post]] and [[https://github.com/thanhvg/emacs-howdoyou][howdoyou.el]], I decided to build a more robust
experience and make it compatible with Org-mode.

I chose to scrape the StackExchange posts, as StackExchange's API only allows
searching/getting posts from a single site.

* Usage
Run ~M-x asx~ and enter query when prompted.
